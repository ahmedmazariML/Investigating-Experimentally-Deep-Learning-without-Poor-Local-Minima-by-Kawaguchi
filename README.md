# Investigating-Experimentally-Deep-Learning-without-Poor-Local-Minima-by-Kawaguchi

In a recent work by Kawaguchi (Kawaguchi, 2016), it as been claimed that under several assumptions met in practice, 
all local minima of the training loss function are equivalent feedforward models. An experimental assessment of such claims is
proposed by training pairs of identical networks with different weight initialization. In addition to comparing loss values,
several other metrics are considered in order to compare model similarity regarding label classifications and generalization.
